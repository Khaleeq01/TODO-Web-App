# TODO-Web-App
A basic todo web app

Build a TODO List app. In this app, users can create to-do lists, where they can add list of Tasks. The Task created by user then should be stored in the Database.
Under each list, add "Cards," which are items in a list. Add a due date, a checklist and labels to each card.
